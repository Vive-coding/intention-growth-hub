# Final Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Added Reprioritizing State
**File:** `client/src/pages/chat/components/PrioritizationCard.tsx`

When user clicks "Re-prioritize" button:
- Button changes to "Re-prioritizing..." (disabled state)
- Visual feedback that their action was received
- State persists to localStorage

### 2. ✅ Improved Tool's Title Matching
**File:** `server/ai/tools/prioritizeTools.ts`

Enhanced pattern matching to extract goal titles from agent's reasoning:
- Pattern 1: Numbered lists "1. Goal Title"
- Pattern 2: "Prioritize: Goal Title, Another Goal"
- Pattern 3: Quoted titles "Goal Title"
- Fuzzy matching: exact match first, then partial match
- Better logging to debug matching issues

### 3. ✅ Updated Agent Prompt for Better Feedback Handling
**File:** `server/ai/singleAgent.ts`

Added explicit workflow for re-prioritization:
- MUST call get_context("all_goals") FIRST to see exact goal titles
- Then call prioritize_goals with specific titles from that list
- Updated playbook 3a to handle user feedback properly
- Added example: "If they say 'I want interview prep, not entering processes'"

## How It Should Work Now

### When User Clicks "Re-prioritize":
1. Card shows "Re-prioritizing..." button
2. Agent receives message: "I want to see different priorities"
3. Agent calls get_context("all_goals") to see ALL available goals
4. Agent analyzes feedback and selects different goals
5. Agent calls prioritize_goals with those specific goal titles
6. Tool extracts titles and finds matching goals (with fuzzy matching)
7. New card appears with different goals

### User Feedback Example:
"I want interview prep, not entering processes"
↓
Agent: Calls get_context("all_goals")
↓
Agent: Finds goal "Prepare for interview using..." (actual title)
↓
Agent: Calls prioritize_goals with that exact title
↓
Tool: Matches the title and selects that goal
↓
Card: Shows interview prep goal instead of "entering processes"

## Testing

Check server logs for:
```
=== [prioritize_goals] TOOL CALLED ===
[prioritize_goals] Reasoning provided: ...
[prioritize_goals] Available goals: ...
[prioritize_goals] Extracted titles from reasoning: ...
[prioritize_goals] Final selected goals: ...
```

This will show if the tool is receiving the agent's reasoning and what goals it's selecting.
