# Root Cause Analysis: Why No Cards Are Rendering

## Problem Summary

The agent is **enabled and has access to tools** but never **calls them**, resulting in text-only conversations with no cards or actual database changes.

## Evidence

1. ✅ Server confirms: `USE_TOOL_AGENT: true`
2. ✅ All 10 tools are loaded
3. ✅ Tools are available to the agent
4. ❌ Agent responds with text only (no tool calls)
5. ❌ No structured data returned
6. ❌ No database changes made

## Root Cause

The agent is being **too conversational and polite** rather than **action-oriented**. 

**Current Prompt Behavior:**
- "Understanding what's on top of their mind"
- "Discovering goals through open-ended dialogue"
- "Automatically calling create_goal_with_habits when goals are recognized"
- "Gather needed info through conversation first, then call tools"

This gives the agent permission to chat indefinitely without taking action.

## What Should Happen

**User says:** "Can you suggest the target dates, and based on what you know about me can you prioritize these goals"

**Expected Behavior:**
Agent should IMMEDIATELY call `create_goal_with_habits` with the goals already discussed.

**Actual Behavior:**
Agent just continues the conversation: "Here's a suggested prioritization..."

## The Fix Needed

The prompt needs to be **explicitly action-oriented**:

1. Change from: "When user wants to work toward something new"
2. Change to: "You MUST call create_goal_with_habits when user confirms they want to work on goals"

3. Add enforcement: "If a user lists goals AND agrees to create them, you MUST call the tool immediately. Do NOT ask for permission."

4. Change examples from passive to active:
   - OLD: "Ongoing chat: 'I'm feeling stuck' → Use chat history to understand context"
   - NEW: "Ongoing chat: 'I'm feeling stuck' → Use chat history, THEN call suggest_habits_for_goal tool"

## Why This Is Happening

LangChain's AgentExecutor lets the agent choose whether to call tools. Without strong enforcement in the prompt, the agent defaults to human-like responses.

The fix is to make the prompt **dictate behavior** rather than **suggest behavior**.

## Next Steps

1. Update the system prompt to be more action-oriented
2. Add examples where tool calls are REQUIRED (not optional)
3. Change "WHEN TO TAKE ACTION" from suggestions to requirements
4. Add explicit instructions: "If user says 'let's create' or 'create these', call the tool immediately"
