## How to Test

### Option 1: Test Script (Quick Validation)

```bash
cd /Users/vivekanandaramu/AI/intention-growth-hub

# Set the feature flag
export USE_TOOL_AGENT=true

# Run test script
npx tsx server/ai/testToolAgent.ts
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Testing Tool-Based Agent

📨 Sending message: I want to get better at my career
⏳ Processing with tool agent...

✅ Agent Response:
Text: [Agent's natural language response]

📊 Structured Data: { type: "goal_suggestion", goal: {...}, habits: [...] }

🔧 Tool Calls: 2
  1. get_context
  2. create_goal_with_habits

✅ Test completed successfully!
```

### Option 2: Test in UI (Full Integration)

```bash
# Start server with new agent enabled
USE_TOOL_AGENT=true npm run dev
```

Then in the chat UI, try:
- **"I want to launch my own app"** → Should create goal with habits
- **"Show me my current goals"** → Should call get_context
- **"What habits would help with my career?"** → Should suggest habits
- **"I completed my morning workout today"** → Should show habit review

### Option 3: Test With Both Systems (A/B Test)

Terminal 1 (Old system):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Terminal 2 (New system):
```bash
USE_TOOL_AGENT=true npm run dev
```

Compare outputs side-by-side!

## Monitoring Logs

Watch for these console logs:

### ✅ Success Logs
```
[lifeCoachService] Using NEW tool-based agent
[lifeCoachService] Tool agent result: {
  textLength: 234,
  hasStructuredData: true,
  structuredDataType: 'goal_suggestion'
}
```

### ⚠️ Fallback Logs (Expected During Testing)
```
[lifeCoachService] Tool agent error: [error details]
[lifeCoachService] Falling back to old agent router
[lifeCoachService] Using OLD agent router
```

### 🔧 Tool Execution Logs
```
[getContextTool] Error fetching habits: [schema issue]
```

---

## Known Issues (Will Fix During Testing)

### Schema Mismatches (37 linting warnings)
These are expected and will be fixed incrementally as we test:

1. **habitCompletions table** - Need to query correct table for streaks
2. **Insight relationships** - Need to join `insightLifeMetrics` and `insightVotes`
3. **Tool config access** - May need adjustment for userId passing
4. **Null safety** - Add checks for optional fields

**Strategy:** Test each tool individually → Fix schema issues as they appear → Move to next tool

---

## Card Compatibility ✅

The new tools return the **same card types** your frontend already handles:

| Tool Output | Frontend Card | Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| `goal_suggestion` | `GoalSuggestionCard.tsx` | ✅ Compatible |
| `habit_review` | `HabitCard.tsx` | ✅ Compatible |
| `habit_suggestions` | `HabitCard.tsx` | ✅ Compatible |
| `insight` | Insight card | ✅ Compatible |
| `progress_update` | New (simple) | 🆕 Need to add |
| `progress_summary` | New (dashboard) | 🆕 Need to add |
| `goal_celebration` | New (confetti) | 🆕 Need to add |

**3 new card types to add** (but existing cards work now!)

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Testing (Current) ✅
- [x] Create tools
- [x] Create single agent
- [x] Integrate with feature flag
- [ ] Test each tool individually
- [ ] Fix schema issues as they appear

### Phase 2: Validation (Next)
- [ ] Test all 11 tools work end-to-end
- [ ] Verify cards render correctly
- [ ] Compare quality with old agents
- [ ] Test fallback mechanism

### Phase 3: Full Deployment
- [ ] Enable `USE_TOOL_AGENT=true` in production
- [ ] Monitor for 24-48 hours
- [ ] Delete old agent files if successful
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 4: Enhancement
- [ ] Add 3 new card types (progress_update, progress_summary, goal_celebration)
- [ ] Add optimization tool with My Focus integration
- [ ] Add accountability tool

## Advantages Over Old System

### Before (Old Multi-Agent System)
- ❌ 6 specialized agents
- ❌ Complex routing logic
- ❌ Hard to add new capabilities
- ❌ Limited tool access
- ❌ ~1500 LOC across multiple files

### After (New Tool-Based Agent)
- ✅ 1 intelligent agent
- ✅ 11 specialized tools (easy to extend)
- ✅ LangChain handles routing
- ✅ Tools can call each other
- ✅ ~1000 LOC (net -500 lines)
- ✅ Self-documenting (tool descriptions)
- ✅ Easier to test
- ✅ More flexible conversations

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   USE_TOOL_AGENT=true npx tsx server/ai/testToolAgent.ts
   ```

2. **Check for errors** and report back

3. **Test in UI** with simple conversation

4. **Fix schema issues** as they appear during testing

5. **Iterate** until all 11 tools work correctly

## Questions?

- **Where are the old agents?** Still in `server/ai/agents/` (will delete after validation)
- **Can I switch back?** Yes! Just set `USE_TOOL_AGENT=false` or remove the env var
- **What if it breaks?** Automatic fallback to old system
- **How do I debug?** Check console logs with `[lifeCoachService]` and tool names

---

**Status: ✅ Ready for Testing**

Run `USE_TOOL_AGENT=true npm run dev` and let's see what happens! 🚀
