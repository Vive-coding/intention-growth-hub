# Prioritization Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend - Count Endpoint ✅
- Added `/api/goals/count/active` endpoint
- Returns count of active, non-archived goals
- Used to determine if prioritization is needed (≥ 3 active goals)

### 2. Frontend - Goal Card Smart Behavior ✅
- `GoalSuggestionCard.tsx` now checks active goal count
- If < 3 goals: Shows "Added to My Focus" + "View My Focus" button
- If ≥ 3 goals: Shows "Needs Prioritization" + triggers message to agent
- Sends message: "I just added a new goal. Please help me prioritize my focus."

### 3. Agent - Prioritization Detection ✅
- Added prioritization trigger instructions to agent prompt
- Agent detects when user has 4+ active goals
- Agent will:
  1. Call `get_context("my_focus")` to see all goals
  2. Recommend top 3 priorities based on recency, urgency, progress
  3. Use MyFocusService to create priority snapshot
  4. Explain reasoning and ask for acceptance

## How It Works

### Flow:
1. User accepts goal card
2. Frontend counts active goals
3. If ≥ 3: Sends prioritization message to agent
4. Agent detects trigger and fetches all active goals
5. Agent selects top 3 and creates snapshot
6. Agent explains selection to user
7. User can accept or suggest changes

## Current State

### ✅ Works:
- Count endpoint
- Frontend goal counting
- UI states (added/pending)
- Message to agent
- Agent detection trigger

### ⚠️ Pending:
- Need prioritization card component
- Need to wire up MyFocusService.persistFromAgent() call
- Need habit optimization after prioritization

## Next Steps

1. **Create PrioritizationCard component** - Shows top 3 goals for acceptance
2. **Wire MyFocusService** - Agent needs to call persistence method
3. **Add habit optimization** - After priorities accepted, optimize habits
4. **Test end-to-end** - Create 4 goals and verify flow
