# Prompt Updated Successfully âœ…

## What Was Changed
- **File**: `server/ai/singleAgent.ts`
- **Lines**: 18-221 (the entire `LIFE_COACH_PROMPT` constant)
- **Status**: New prompt replaces old one

## Key Improvements
1. **Clearer voice** - More conversational, less robotic
2. **Better tool guidance** - Explicit "when to use" for each tool
3. **Real examples** - 5 concrete conversation examples
4. **Mode handling** - Properly handles {mode} and {context_instructions} placeholders
5. **Safety rules** - Never shame, never overwhelm, always connect to meaning
6. **Mandatory prioritization** - Automatic focus when 4+ goals detected

## Testing Needed
After server restart, test:
1. Does agent call tools appropriately?
2. Are cards rendering?
3. Does prioritization trigger correctly?
4. Is voice warmer/more human?
