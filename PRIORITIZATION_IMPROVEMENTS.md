# Prioritization Improvements - Final

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Added Checkboxes to Individual Priority Items

**User can now select which priorities to accept**, not all-or-nothing.

**Changes in `PrioritizationCard.tsx`:**
- Added `selectedItems` state to track which items are checked
- Default: All priorities checked (user can uncheck if they disagree)
- Each priority item now has a checkbox on the left
- "Accept Selected" button shows count: "Accept Selected (2 of 3)"
- If no items selected, shows alert: "Please select at least one priority to accept"

### 2. ✅ Updated Agent Prompt for Reprioritization Feedback

**Agent now understands when user wants to re-prioritize and adjusts based on feedback.**

**Changes in `singleAgent.ts`:**
- Added "Re-Prioritization / Disagreement" playbook (section 3a)
- Agent now:
  - Triggers when user says they want to re-prioritize
  - **Asks what's wrong** with current priorities
  - **Listens to feedback** (e.g., "I'm already sleeping 7 hours")
  - **Incorporates feedback** into reasoning when calling prioritize_goals
  - Can handle specific requests like "interview prep should be #1"
- Updated tool description to include: "If re-prioritizing: incorporate the user's feedback about what's wrong"

### 3. ✅ Added "Re-prioritize" Button

**Quick way for user to ask for different priorities.**

**Changes in `PrioritizationCard.tsx`:**
- Added third button: "Re-prioritize" (amber colored)
- Clicking sends message: "I want to see different priorities. Can you re-prioritize my goals?"
- Agent receives this and follows the reprioritization playbook

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User Disagrees with Priorities
1. Agent suggests: [Goal A, Goal B, Goal C]
2. User unchecks Goal B (doesn't agree with it)
3. User clicks "Accept Selected (2 of 3)"
4. Only Goal A and Goal C are accepted and shown in My Focus

### Scenario 2: User Wants Completely Different Priorities
1. Agent suggests: [Goal A, Goal B, Goal C]
2. User clicks "Re-prioritize"
3. Agent asks: "Which priorities don't fit? Why?"
4. User: "I'm already sleeping 7 hours, that's not a priority"
5. Agent analyzes goals again, incorporating feedback
6. Agent calls prioritize_goals with NEW reasoning that excludes the sleeping goal
7. Shows new priorities: [Goal X, Goal Y, Goal Z]

### Scenario 3: Selective Acceptance
1. User sees priorities with checkboxes
2. Unchecks items they disagree with
3. Clicks "Accept Selected (2 of 3)"
4. Only checked items are prioritized

## Benefits

1. **User Control**: Can accept some priorities but not all
2. **Feedback Loop**: When they disagree, agent adjusts the selection
3. **Quick Action**: "Re-prioritize" button for easy re-requesting
4. **Transparency**: Count shows exactly how many items selected
