# Final Fix Summary

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Prompt Placeholder Error ❌
- **Error**: "Missing value for input variable `mode`"
- **Root Cause**: Prompt had `{mode}` and `{context_instructions}` but LangChain was looking for them as input variables
- **Fix**: Removed placeholders from prompt template, build the full prompt string before passing to LangChain

### 2. Tool User ID Error ❌  
- **Error**: "User ID required" when tools tried to execute
- **Root Cause**: Tools looking for `config.configurable.userId` which wasn't being passed properly
- **Fix**: Changed tools to use global `__TOOL_USER_ID__` variable

## Files Changed

### `server/ai/singleAgent.ts`
- Lines 18-221: Prompt without `{mode}` placeholders
- Lines 227-237: Dynamic prompt building with mode/context injection

### `server/ai/tools/goalTools.ts`
- Lines 112-114: Now uses global variables instead of config

## What Should Work Now

1. ✅ Agent should start without errors
2. ✅ Tools should receive userId properly
3. ✅ Tools can execute successfully
4. ✅ Agent should call tools when appropriate
5. ✅ Cards should render in UI

## Next Steps

1. Restart server
2. Test the conversation again
3. Check logs for successful tool execution
4. Verify cards appear
