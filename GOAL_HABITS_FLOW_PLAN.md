# REVISED PLAN: Suggested Goals with Habits Flow

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

Implement a multi-step wizard for accepting suggested goals that includes habit selection and target setting, reusing existing UI patterns from `AddHabitModal`.

---

## **Multi-Step Flow Design**

### **Flow:** Goal Details â†’ Select Habits â†’ Set Habit Targets

### **Step 1: Goal Details & Target Date**
- Goal title (pre-filled from suggestion)
- Goal description (pre-filled)
- Life metric (pre-selected, read-only)
- **Target date** (user input - required)
- Target value (optional, default to 1)

### **Step 2: Select Habits** *(Reuses existing habit selection pattern)*
- **AI-Suggested Habits** for this specific goal:
  - Display with priority badges (Essential/Helpful/Optional)
  - Display high-leverage badge (ðŸŒŸ) for multi-goal habits
  - Pre-select "Essential" habits by default
- **Existing Habits** that match the life metric:
  - Show which goals they're already associated with
  - Indicate which are high-leverage
- Allow multi-select
- Option to skip (habits can be added later)

### **Step 3: Set Habit Targets** *(Reuses existing target setting UI)*
- For each selected habit:
  - Frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)
  - Per-period target (e.g., 1x per day)
  - Periods count (auto-calculated from goal's target date)
- Show total completions required
- Display daily habit count warning if approaching 10
- Final action: Create goal + associate habits

---

## **Key Design Decisions**

1. **Reuse Existing UI Patterns**: Leverage the 3-step wizard in `AddHabitModal.tsx` (lines 56-69)
2. **Goal-Specific Habits**: AI generates 2-3 habits per goal (nested structure)
3. **High-Leverage Identification**: Mark habits that can serve multiple goals
4. **Context-Aware AI**: Use recent accepted goals/habits to prevent duplicates
5. **Habit Count Management**: Keep total daily habits under 10

---

## **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Database Schema Changes** âœ…

#### 1.1 Create Goal-Habit Link Table
```sql
-- Links suggested habits to suggested goals
CREATE TABLE suggested_goal_habits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  suggested_goal_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES suggested_goals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  suggested_habit_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES suggested_habits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  priority INTEGER DEFAULT 1, -- 1=essential, 2=helpful, 3=optional
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(suggested_goal_id, suggested_habit_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_suggested_goal_habits_goal ON suggested_goal_habits(suggested_goal_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_suggested_goal_habits_habit ON suggested_goal_habits(suggested_habit_id);
```

#### 1.2 Enhance Suggested Habits Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE suggested_habits 
ADD COLUMN is_high_leverage BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN applicable_goal_types TEXT[], -- ['career', 'health', 'personal']
ADD COLUMN novelty_score INTEGER CHECK (novelty_score >= 1 AND novelty_score <= 10),
ADD COLUMN impact_score INTEGER CHECK (impact_score >= 1 AND impact_score <= 10),
ADD COLUMN actionability_score INTEGER CHECK (actionability_score >= 1 AND actionability_score <= 10);
```

---

### **Phase 2: AI Agent Enhancements**

#### 2.1 Add Context Builder Service

**New File:** `server/services/contextBuilder.ts`

**Purpose:** Fetch recent user activity to provide context for AI

**Methods:**
- `getRecentAcceptedGoals(userId)` - Last 3-5 accepted goals (30 days)
- `getRecentAcceptedHabits(userId)` - Last 3-5 accepted habits (30 days)
- `getUpvotedInsights(userId)` - Last 5 upvoted insights
- `getCurrentDailyHabitCount(userId)` - Count of active daily habits

**Usage:** Called before AI agent processes journal entry

#### 2.2 Update AI Prompt Template

**File:** `server/ai/agent.ts` (lines 172-294)

**Key Additions:**

```
GOAL-HABIT STRUCTURE:
For each suggested goal, provide 2-3 specific habits:
- priority: 1 (Essential) - Critical for goal success
- priority: 2 (Helpful) - Supportive but not required
- priority: 3 (Optional) - Nice to have

HIGH LEVERAGE CRITERIA:
- Habit supports multiple goal types
- Habit is a meta-skill (reflection, learning, communication)
- Mark with isHighLeverage: true
- Example: "Energy Autopsy" helps career, health, personal goals

NOVELTY REQUIREMENTS:
Current daily habits: {currentDailyHabitCount}/10
- Habits must be NOVEL and INTERESTING
- Users should feel proud to share with others
- Not generic ("go for a walk", "meditate")
- Include specific triggers and actions

CONTEXT TO AVOID DUPLICATES:
{recentAcceptedGoals}
{recentAcceptedHabits}
{upvotedInsights}

HIGH-LEVERAGE EXAMPLES:
âœ“ "Energy Autopsy" (Daily): One line - what gave/drained energy?
âœ“ "Future Self Ping" (Weekly): Note to "3 months from now me"
âœ“ "Skill Dividend" (Weekly): Apply existing skill in new context
âœ“ "Uncomfortable Compliment" (Daily/Weekly): Vulnerable compliment
âœ“ "Micro-Adventure" (Weekly): Try one novel thing
âœ“ "Second Brain Snapshot" (Daily): Most surprising learning

Output Format:
{
  "suggestedGoals": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "lifeMetricId": "uuid",
      "habits": [
        {
          "title": "string",
          "description": "string",
          "priority": 1,
          "isHighLeverage": true,
          "applicableGoalTypes": ["career", "personal"],
          "frequency": "daily",
          "targetCount": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2.3 Update Insight Service

**File:** `server/services/insightService.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Fetch context using `ContextBuilder`
2. Pass context to AI agent
3. Update goal/habit creation to handle nested structure:
   - Create goal
   - Create habits for goal
   - Link habits to goal via `suggested_goal_habits`

---

### **Phase 3: Backend API Updates**

#### 3.1 New Endpoint: Get Suggested Habits for Goal

```typescript
// GET /api/goals/suggested/:goalId/habits
// Returns:
// - suggestedHabits: habits linked to this goal (with priority)
// - existingHabits: user's existing habits in same life metric
// - goal: the suggested goal details
```

#### 3.2 Update Goal Creation Endpoint

```typescript
// POST /api/goals
{
  title: string,
  description: string,
  lifeMetricId: string,
  targetValue: number,
  targetDate: string,          // Required for target calculation
  habitIds?: string[],          // Existing habit IDs
  suggestedHabitIds?: string[], // Suggested habit IDs to promote
  habitTargets?: {              // Target settings per habit
    [habitId: string]: {
      frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly',
      perPeriodTarget: number,
      periodsCount: number
    }
  }
}
```

**Process:**
1. Create goal definition
2. Create goal instance
3. Promote suggested habits â†’ habit definitions
4. Associate all habits with goal (create habit instances)
5. Record feedback events for accepted habits
6. Archive suggested goal

#### 3.3 Helper: Promote Suggested Habit

```typescript
async function promoteSuggestedHabit(
  suggestedHabitId: string,
  userId: string
): Promise<HabitDefinition>
```

**Process:**
1. Fetch suggested habit
2. Create habit definition
3. Archive suggested habit
4. Return habit definition

#### 3.4 Update Storage Service

**File:** `server/storage.ts`

**Add Methods:**
- `linkSuggestedGoalHabit()` - Link habit to goal
- `getSuggestedHabitsForGoal()` - Get habits for a goal with priority

---

### **Phase 4: Frontend UI Changes**

#### 4.1 Create Goal Creation Wizard Component

**New File:** `client/src/components/CreateGoalWizard.tsx`

**Props:**
```typescript
interface CreateGoalWizardProps {

3. Update "Add to Life Metric" button click handler
4. Render wizard when goal selected

**Button Handler (line ~930):**
```typescript
onClick={() => {
  setSelectedSuggestedGoal({
    id: goal.id,
    title: goal.title,
    description: goal.description,
    lifeMetricId: goal.lifeMetric?.id,
    lifeMetricName: goal.lifeMetric?.name,
    lifeMetricColor: goal.lifeMetric?.color
  });
  setShowGoalWizard(true);
}}
```

---

### **Phase 5: Migration & Schema Updates**

#### Migration File Structure

**File:** `migrations/0005_add_goal_habit_suggestions.sql`

```sql
-- Add goal-habit linking table
CREATE TABLE suggested_goal_habits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  suggested_goal_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES suggested_goals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  suggested_habit_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES suggested_habits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  priority INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(suggested_goal_id, suggested_habit_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_suggested_goal_habits_goal ON suggested_goal_habits(suggested_goal_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_suggested_goal_habits_habit ON suggested_goal_habits(suggested_habit_id);

-- Enhance suggested habits table
ALTER TABLE suggested_habits 
ADD COLUMN is_high_leverage BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN applicable_goal_types TEXT[],
ADD COLUMN novelty_score INTEGER CHECK (novelty_score >= 1 AND novelty_score <= 10),
ADD COLUMN impact_score INTEGER CHECK (impact_score >= 1 AND impact_score <= 10),
ADD COLUMN actionability_score INTEGER CHECK (actionability_score >= 1 AND actionability_score <= 10);
```

**File:** `shared/schema.ts`

Add new table definition:

```typescript
export const suggestedGoalHabits = pgTable("suggested_goal_habits", {
  id: uuid("id").defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  suggestedGoalId: uuid("suggested_goal_id").notNull().references(() => suggestedGoals.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  suggestedHabitId: uuid("suggested_habit_id").notNull().references(() => suggestedHabits.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  priority: integer("priority").default(1),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
});
```

Update `suggestedHabits` table:

```typescript
export const suggestedHabits = pgTable("suggested_habits", {
  // ... existing fields
  isHighLeverage: boolean("is_high_leverage").default(false),
  applicableGoalTypes: text("applicable_goal_types").array(),
  noveltyScore: integer("novelty_score"),
  impactScore: integer("impact_score"),
  actionabilityScore: integer("actionability_score"),
});
```

Add relations:

```typescript
export const suggestedGoalHabitsRelations = relations(suggestedGoalHabits, ({ one }) => ({
  suggestedGoal: one(suggestedGoals, {
    fields: [suggestedGoalHabits.suggestedGoalId],
    references: [suggestedGoals.id],
  }),
  suggestedHabit: one(suggestedHabits, {
    fields: [suggestedGoalHabits.suggestedHabitId],
    references: [suggestedHabits.id],
  }),
}));
```

## **Example End-to-End Flow**

### User Journey:

**1. User Writes Journal:**
> "I want to get better at system design. I need to study consistently and apply what I learn."

**2. AI Generates Insight:**
- Title: "Ready to commit to technical skill development"
- Life Metric: Career Growth
- Confidence: 85%

**3. AI Suggests Goal with Habits:**

**Goal:** "Complete 3 system design courses by Q2"

**Habits:**
1. **"Learning Snapshot"** (Daily, Essential, ðŸŒŸ High-Leverage)
   - "Each evening, write one sentence about the most valuable thing you learned today"
   - Applicable to: Career, Personal Development
   - Priority: 1 (Essential)

2. **"Skill Dividend"** (Weekly, Essential, ðŸŒŸ High-Leverage)
   - "Apply one system design concept to a real problem this week"
   - Applicable to: Career, Personal Development
   - Priority: 1 (Essential)

3. **"Study Time Block"** (Daily, Helpful)
   - "Dedicate 30 minutes to course work before checking email"
   - Priority: 2 (Helpful)

**4. User Accepts Goal:**
- Clicks "Add to Career Growth"
- `CreateGoalWizard` opens

**Step 1:**
- Title: "Complete 3 system design courses by Q2" âœ“
- Description: pre-filled âœ“
- Target Date: User selects "June 30, 2025"
- Clicks "Next"

**Step 2:**
- Sees 3 suggested habits (1 & 2 pre-selected as Essential)
- Notices ðŸŒŸ badge on habits 1 & 2
- Deselects habit 3 (not needed)
- Clicks "Next"

**Step 3:**
- **Learning Snapshot:**
  - Frequency: Daily
  - Per period: 1x
  - Periods: 120 days (auto-calculated)
  - Total: 120 completions

- **Skill Dividend:**
  - Frequency: Weekly
  - Per period: 1x
  - Periods: 17 weeks (auto-calculated)
  - Total: 17 completions

- Daily habit count: 8/10 âœ“
- Clicks "Create Goal"

**5. Backend Processing:**
- Creates goal definition + instance
- Promotes 2 suggested habits â†’ habit definitions
- Creates 2 habit instances linked to goal
- Archives suggested goal
- Records 3 feedback events (goal accept + 2 habit accepts)
- Updates suggestion memory

**6. Result:**
- Goal appears in user's Career Growth section
- 2 habits appear in daily habit list
- User can start completing habits immediately

**7. Next Journal Entry:**
- AI sees context: "Recently accepted: System design courses goal"
- AI sees context: "Recently accepted: Learning Snapshot, Skill Dividend"
- AI avoids suggesting duplicate habits
- AI builds on this foundation with complementary suggestions

---

## **Success Metrics**

After implementation, track:

1. **Adoption Rate**: % of suggested goals accepted with habits
2. **Habit Selection**: Avg habits selected per goal (target: 2-3)
3. **High-Leverage Usage**: % of high-leverage habits selected
4. **Daily Habit Count**: Avg active daily habits per user (keep <10)
5. **Completion Rate**: Do users complete these habits?
6. **Novelty Score**: User feedback on habit creativity
7. **Context Effectiveness**: % reduction in duplicate suggestions

---

## **Future Enhancements** (Post-MVP)

- Evaluate habit quality before showing to users
- Score: novelty, actionability, impact
- Filter out low-quality suggestions

### 2. Habit Impact Analytics
- Track which habits lead to goal completion
- Identify high-performing habit patterns
- Use data to improve future suggestions

### 3. Habit Consolidation
- Suggest merging similar habits
- Auto-archive habits that become automatic
- Recommend habit graduation system

### 4. Cross-Goal Habit Analysis
- Identify habits that could serve multiple goals
- Proactively suggest high-leverage habits
- Build habit-goal impact matrix

## **Ready to Implement! ðŸš€**

**Recommended Implementation Order:**

1. **Start with Phase 1** (Database) - 30 min
   - Creates foundation for everything else
   - Can test schema changes independently

2. **Then Phase 2** (Context & AI) - 2 hours
   - Context builder is straightforward
   - AI prompt updates are iterative (can refine later)
   - Test with journal entries to see goal+habit output

3. **Then Phase 3** (Backend API) - 2 hours
   - Storage methods are simple CRUD
   - API endpoints build on existing patterns
   - Test with Postman/curl

4. **Finally Phase 4** (Frontend) - 3 hours
   - Wizard component is the biggest piece
   - Reuses existing UI components
   - Most visible impact for users

**Total Estimated Time: 7-8 hours**
