# Server Restarted Successfully âœ…

## Status
- **Process ID**: 29444
- **Tool Agent**: ENABLED (USE_TOOL_AGENT=true)
- **Location**: `/Users/vivekanandaramu/AI/intention-growth-hub`
- **Log File**: `server.log`

## New Features Available
1. **Goal Count Endpoint**: `/api/goals/count/active`
2. **Prioritization Tool**: `prioritize_goals` tool available to agent
3. **Smart Goal Cards**: Automatically trigger prioritization when â‰¥ 3 goals
4. **PrioritizationCard**: Renders top 3 goals in priority order

## Testing Instructions
1. Use simulation buttons to create threads:
   - Click "ðŸ“‹ Create Plan Ahead Simulation"
   - Click "ðŸ“Š Create Review Progress Simulation"
2. Create 4+ goals to trigger prioritization flow
3. Accept goal cards and verify prioritization appears
4. Check agent logs for `prioritize_goals` tool calls
5. Verify cards render correctly in chat
6. Check "My Focus" to see priority updates

## Next Steps for Golden Dataset
- Create multiple threads with various states:
  - Thread with < 3 goals (no prioritization)
  - Thread with 4+ goals (prioritization triggered)
  - Thread with completed goals
  - Thread with habit completions
  - Thread with optimization suggestions
