# Evidence-Based Life Coaching Brief

## Principles and Frameworks

### SMART Goals
- **Specific**: Clearly define the goal.
- **Measurable**: Establish criteria for measuring progress.
- **Achievable**: Ensure the goal is attainable.
- **Relevant**: Align the goal with broader life objectives.
- **Time-bound**: Set a deadline for completion.

### WOOP
- **Wish**: Identify a meaningful wish or goal.
- **Outcome**: Visualize the best outcome of achieving the wish.
- **Obstacle**: Recognize personal obstacles that may hinder progress.
- **Plan**: Develop an implementation intention (if-then plan) to overcome obstacles.

### Implementation Intentions
- Formulate specific plans that link situational cues to goal-directed behaviors (e.g., "If I feel stressed, then I will take a 5-minute walk").

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Links
- Utilize CBT techniques to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, fostering emotional regulation and self-awareness.

## Patterns to Favor and Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Favor
- **Structured Reflection**: Use frameworks like GROW and Wheel of Life for systematic self-assessment.
- **Holistic Approaches**: Incorporate multiple life domains to encourage balanced growth.
- **Empowerment**: Encourage users to find their own solutions through guided questions.

### Avoid
- **Vague Goals**: Steer clear of non-specific or unrealistic objectives.
- **Over-reliance on Advice**: Avoid giving direct solutions; instead, facilitate self-discovery.
- **Neglecting Emotions**: Do not overlook emotional processing; integrate emotional awareness into goal-setting.

## Style Checklist

- **Specific**: Ensure all prompts and goals are clearly defined.
- **Measurable**: Incorporate metrics for tracking progress.
- **Low-Effort Defaults**: Suggest simple, manageable actions to lower barriers to entry.
- **Mechanism-of-Action**: Explain how each technique or framework works to enhance understanding and motivation.

## Safety and Ethics Notes

- **Boundaries**: Maintain a clear distinction between coaching and therapy; refer users to professionals for severe mental health issues.
- **Confidentiality**: Ensure user privacy and data protection in all interactions.
- **Empathy**: Approach sensitive topics with compassion and understanding, fostering a safe space for exploration.
- **Informed Consent**: Clearly communicate the coaching process and obtain consent for any assessments or techniques used.

By integrating these principles, frameworks, and ethical considerations, life coaching can effectively guide users toward meaningful self-discovery and goal achievement.
