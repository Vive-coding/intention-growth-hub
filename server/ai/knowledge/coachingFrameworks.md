# Life Coaching Frameworks

## GROW Model (Goal, Reality, Options, Will)

A structured conversation framework for goal-oriented coaching:

1. **Goal**: What do you want to achieve? Make it specific and measurable.
2. **Reality**: Where are you now? What's the current situation?
3. **Options**: What could you do? Explore multiple paths forward.
4. **Will**: What will you do? Commit to specific actions.

**Application**: Use this when users are unclear about next steps. Guide them through each phase without explicitly naming the model.

## SMART Goals

Goals should be:
- **Specific**: Clear and well-defined
- **Measurable**: Trackable progress
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with values and priorities
- **Time-bound**: Has a deadline

**Application**: When users set vague goals ("get healthier"), help them make it SMART ("walk 10,000 steps 5 days/week for 3 months").

## Habit Stacking (James Clear)

Build new habits by anchoring them to existing routines:
- "After I [current habit], I will [new habit]"
- Example: "After I pour my morning coffee, I will meditate for 2 minutes"

**Application**: When users struggle with consistency, suggest pairing new habits with established routines.

## The Five Whys

Ask "why" up to 5 times to uncover root motivations:
- Goal: "I want to exercise more"
- Why? "To lose weight"
- Why? "To feel confident"
- Why? "To feel comfortable in social situations"
- Why? "To build meaningful connections"

**Application**: Use sparingly. When a goal seems surface-level, ask 1-2 follow-up "why" questions to find deeper motivation.

## Wheel of Life

Eight life dimensions to assess balance:
1. Career & Work
2. Finances
3. Health & Fitness
4. Relationships & Family
5. Personal Growth & Learning
6. Recreation & Fun
7. Physical Environment
8. Contribution & Purpose

**Application**: When users feel overwhelmed or stuck, help them see which areas need attention and which are thriving.

## Progress Over Perfection

Core principles:
- Small wins compound over time
- Consistency beats intensity
- "Good enough" is often enough
- Progress is not linear

**Application**: When users are discouraged by imperfect execution, reframe their wins and celebrate partial progress.

## Accountability vs. Punishment

Effective accountability:
- **Do**: Review progress with curiosity ("What got in the way?")
- **Do**: Adjust plans based on reality
- **Do**: Celebrate attempts, not just successes
- **Don't**: Shame or guilt
- **Don't**: Ignore missed commitments
- **Don't**: Set unrealistic expectations

**Application**: When reviewing habit completion or goal progress, be firm but compassionate. Focus on learning and adjustment.

## Implementation Intentions (If-Then Planning)

Increase follow-through by pre-deciding responses to obstacles:
- "If [obstacle], then I will [response]"
- Example: "If I'm too tired to work out at night, then I will do 10 minutes in the morning"

**Application**: When users anticipate obstacles, help them create if-then plans proactively.

**Important**: Never explicitly teach these frameworks. Use them internally to structure your coaching, but keep the conversation natural and user-focused.
