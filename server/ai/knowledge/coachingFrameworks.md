# Life Coaching Frameworks

## GROW Model (Goal, Reality, Options, Will)

A structured conversation framework for goal-oriented coaching:

1. **Goal**: What do you want to achieve? Make it specific and measurable.
2. **Reality**: Where are you now? What's the current situation?
3. **Options**: What could you do? Explore multiple paths forward.
4. **Will**: What will you do? Commit to specific actions.

**Application**: Use this when users are unclear about next steps. Guide them through each phase without explicitly naming the model.

## SMART Goals

Goals should be:
- **Specific**: Clear and well-defined
- **Measurable**: Trackable progress
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with values and priorities
- **Time-bound**: Has a deadline

**Application**: When users set vague goals ("get healthier"), help them make it SMART ("walk 10,000 steps 5 days/week for 3 months").

## Habit Stacking (James Clear)

Build new habits by anchoring them to existing routines:
- "After I [current habit], I will [new habit]"
- Example: "After I pour my morning coffee, I will meditate for 2 minutes"

**Application**: When users struggle with consistency, suggest pairing new habits with established routines.

## The Five Whys

Ask "why" up to 5 times to uncover root motivations:
- Goal: "I want to exercise more"
- Why? "To lose weight"
- Why? "To feel confident"
- Why? "To feel comfortable in social situations"
- Why? "To build meaningful connections"

**Application**: Use sparingly. When a goal seems surface-level, ask 1-2 follow-up "why" questions to find deeper motivation.

## Wheel of Life

Eight life dimensions to assess balance:
1. Career & Work
2. Finances
3. Health & Fitness
4. Relationships & Family
5. Personal Growth & Learning
6. Recreation & Fun
7. Physical Environment
8. Contribution & Purpose

**Application**: When users feel overwhelmed or stuck, help them see which areas need attention and which are thriving.

## Progress Over Perfection

Core principles:
- Small wins compound over time
- Consistency beats intensity
- "Good enough" is often enough
- Progress is not linear

**Application**: When users are discouraged by imperfect execution, reframe their wins and celebrate partial progress.

## Accountability vs. Punishment

Effective accountability:
- **Do**: Review progress with curiosity ("What got in the way?")
- **Do**: Adjust plans based on reality
- **Do**: Celebrate attempts, not just successes
- **Don't**: Shame or guilt
- **Don't**: Ignore missed commitments
- **Don't**: Set unrealistic expectations

**Application**: When reviewing habit completion or goal progress, be firm but compassionate. Focus on learning and adjustment.

## Implementation Intentions (If-Then Planning)

Increase follow-through by pre-deciding responses to obstacles:
- "If [obstacle], then I will [response]"
- Example: "If I'm too tired to work out at night, then I will do 10 minutes in the morning"

**Application**: When users anticipate obstacles, help them create if-then plans proactively.

## Ikigai (Purpose and Meaning)

A Japanese concept for finding one's reason for being, represented by four overlapping circles:
1. **What you love**: Your passions and interests
2. **What you're good at**: Your skills and talents
3. **What the world needs**: Problems you can solve or value you can create
4. **What you can be paid for**: Economic viability

The intersection of all four represents ikigai - a sense of purpose that is both personally meaningful and sustainable.

**Application**: When users are unclear about direction, purpose, or what goals to pursue, use ikigai structure internally to ask discovery questions that help identify meaningful goals. Guide questions around passion ("What energizes you?"), skills ("What comes naturally to you?"), impact ("What problems do you want to solve?"), and sustainability ("What could support you long-term?"). Then suggest a path forward that aligns with their unique intersection.

## Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)

A Japanese philosophy focused on small, incremental changes over time:
- Focus on 1% improvements rather than major overhauls
- Small steps are more sustainable and build momentum
- Progress through consistent micro-adjustments
- "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"

**Application**: When users feel overwhelmed, stuck, or intimidated by large goals, use kaizen approach: suggest tiny, incremental steps that build momentum. Break large goals into micro-actions that feel achievable. When they're stuck, propose the smallest possible next step. Emphasize that small consistent progress compounds over time.

## Hansei (Reflection and Self-Correction)

A Japanese practice of structured reflection for continuous improvement:
- Structured reflection: What went well? What didn't? What will I do differently?
- Not about blame or self-criticism, but about learning and adjustment
- Acknowledges mistakes without shame, focuses on growth
- Creates a cycle of action → reflection → adjustment → action

**Application**: When reviewing progress, setbacks, or when users express frustration with their results, guide structured reflection using hansei structure. Help them identify what worked, what didn't, and what adjustments to make. Frame setbacks as learning opportunities. Then suggest concrete adjustments based on the reflection, creating a clear path forward.

**Important**: Never explicitly teach these frameworks. Use them internally to structure your coaching, but keep the conversation natural and user-focused.
