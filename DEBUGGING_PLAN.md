# Debugging and Fix Plan

## Issues Identified

### 1. ⚠️ CRITICAL: LangChain Chain Error
**Symptom**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" when clicking "Optimize focus"
**Location**: `node_modules/@langchain/openai/dist/chat_models.js:207:31`
**Impact**: Complete failure - agent returns fallback message

### 2. Tools Not Triggering
**Symptoms**: 
- "Suggest goals" button doesn't create goals
- "Surprise me" doesn't call insight tool
- Agent is conversational but not action-oriented

### 3. Conversation Context Not Being Used
**Symptom**: Agent keeps asking same questions, not building on previous conversation
**Impact**: Poor user experience, feels repetitive

### 4. Habit Completion Not Persisting
**Symptoms**:
- Review habits card shows but doesn't save completions
- Chat header counter doesn't update
- Completed habits not persisting throughout the day

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: LangChain Chain Error
Looking at the logs (lines 1-560 in terminal output), I can see:
- Agent calls `get_context("all_goals")` successfully (line 32-34)
- FunctionMessage is returned with data (lines 78-556)
- Then error occurs when trying to continue the conversation

**Hypothesis**: The error occurs AFTER a tool returns and LangChain tries to continue the conversation loop. The issue is likely in the `agent_scratchpad` handling or the message conversion.

### Issue 2: Tools Not Triggering
Looking at the conversation:
- User says "Suggest goals based on this and make assumptions" → Agent doesn't call `create_goal_with_habits`
- User says "Surprise me with insights" → Agent doesn't call insight tool
- Agent just gives conversational responses instead

**Hypothesis**: The agent system prompts are too passive. The agent is being conversational instead of action-oriented.

### Issue 3: Context Not Used
- Agent keeps asking same questions
- Doesn't reference previous messages
- Doesn't acknowledge what user just said

**Hypothesis**: Chat history is empty or not being passed correctly to the agent.

### Issue 4: Habit Persistence
- Card shows up
- But completions don't persist
- Counter doesn't update

**Hypothesis**: The habit completion API isn't being called, or the local storage isn't working, or the React Query cache isn't being invalidated.

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix LangChain Error (CRITICAL)

**Step 1.1**: Add detailed logging around the agent_scratchpad
- Already added in `singleAgent.ts` lines 283-292
- Need to see what's happening when the error occurs

**Step 1.2**: Try catching the error and providing more context
```typescript
try {
  const response = await agentExecutor.invoke(...)
} catch (error) {
  console.error("[ERROR DETAILS]");
  console.error("Error:", error);
  console.error("Error stack:", error.stack);
  // Log the exact state of variables at error time
}
```

**Step 1.3**: Check if the issue is with `formatToOpenAIFunctionMessages`
- It might be receiving undefined or malformed steps
- Add try/catch (already done) but need to see the output

**Step 1.4**: Alternative approach - simplify the agent chain
- Remove `agent_scratchpad` temporarily to see if that's the issue
- Or use a different message formatting approach

### Phase 2: Fix Tool Calling

**Step 2.1**: Review and strengthen the system prompt
- Make tool calls MANDATORY not optional
- Add explicit examples of when to call tools
- Remove soft language like "you MAY call"

**Step 2.2**: Add logging for tool decisions
- Log when agent decides NOT to use a tool
- Understand why agent is choosing conversation over action

**Step 2.3**: Test with very explicit prompts
- If user says "create a goal" → MUST call tool
- If user says "surprise me" → MUST call insight tool
- No conversation, just action

### Phase 3: Fix Context Usage

**Step 3.1**: Restore chat history properly
- Currently skipped with empty array
- Need to properly format LangChain messages
- Test with actual conversation history

**Step 3.2**: Add chat history to system prompt
```typescript
const recentMessagesText = recentMessages
  .slice(-6)
  .map(m => `${m.role}: ${m.content}`)
  .join('\n\n');

systemPrompt += `\n\nRecent conversation:\n${recentMessagesText}`;
```

### Phase 4: Fix Habit Persistence

**Step 4.1**: Check the habit completion flow
- Verify the card component calls the API
- Verify the API persists to database
- Verify React Query cache invalidation happens

**Step 4.2**: Add logging to habit completion
```typescript
console.log("[HABIT COMPLETION]");
console.log("Calling API:", url);
console.log("Payload:", payload);
console.log("Response:", response);
```

**Step 4.3**: Check local storage keys
- Verify localStorage keys are correct
- Verify they're being read/written properly

## Testing Strategy

### Test 1: LangChain Error
1. Click "Optimize focus" button
2. Check server logs for error
3. Look for `[agent_scratchpad]` logs
4. Check what data is in `i.steps` when error occurs

### Test 2: Tool Calling
1. Send: "Create a goal to improve my sleep"
2. Check logs for tool call
3. Should see `create_goal_with_habits` being called
4. If not, check why agent decided against it

### Test 3: Context Usage
1. Say: "Let's review my progress"
2. Then: "What did we just discuss?"
3. Agent should reference the review conversation

### Test 4: Habit Persistence
1. Complete a habit in the card
2. Refresh the page
3. Habit should still be marked complete
4. Counter should reflect the completion

## Priority Order

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix LangChain error (blocks all agent functionality)
2. **HIGH**: Fix tool calling (makes agent actually do things)
3. **MEDIUM**: Fix context usage (improves UX)
4. **MEDIUM**: Fix habit persistence (critical for habit tracking)

---

## Next Steps

1. First, get detailed logs from the LangChain error
2. Then fix the error based on what we find
3. Then strengthen the system prompts
4. Then test thoroughly

Let's start with Step 1.1 - getting better logs from the LangChain error.
