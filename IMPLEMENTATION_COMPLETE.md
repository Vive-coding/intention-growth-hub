# Implementation Status: Frontend + Backend Changes

## ✅ Completed

### Backend Changes
1. **Added count endpoint** (`/api/goals/count/active`)
   - Returns count of active, non-archived goals for user
   - Used to determine if prioritization is needed

### Frontend Changes
1. **GoalSuggestionCard.tsx**
   - Counts active goals BEFORE creating new goal
   - If new goal count > 3, sets `needsPrioritization` state
   - Shows different UI states:
     - `< 3 goals`: "Added to My Focus" badge + "View My Focus" button
     - `≥ 4 goals`: "Needs Prioritization" badge + warning message
   - Sends message to agent to trigger prioritization when needed
   - Invalidates queries to refresh "My Focus"

## Current Behavior

### When User Accepts Goal Card:
1. **If < 3 active goals**: 
   - Goal is added
   - Card shows "Added to My Focus"
   - Button: "View My Focus"

2. **If ≥ 3 active goals** (becomes 4+ with new goal):
   - Goal is created
   - Card shows "Needs Prioritization" 
   - Message sent to agent: "I just added a new goal. Please help me prioritize my focus."
   - Agent should call `prioritize_optimize` tool

## ⚠️ Remaining Work

### Next Steps:
1. **Agent Response**: When agent receives the message, it must:
   - Detect the prioritization trigger
   - Call `prioritize_optimize` tool
   - Create priority snapshot with top 3 goals
   - Return prioritization card to user

2. **Prioritization Card**: Need to create component that:
   - Shows top 3 goals selected for priority
   - Allows user to accept/push back
   - On acceptance, triggers habit optimization

3. **Habit Optimization**: After priorities accepted:
   - Agent calls optimize habits tool
   - Suggests optimized habit set
   - Returns optimization card

## Testing Status
- ✅ Count endpoint works
- ✅ Frontend checks count
- ✅ UI states display correctly
- ⚠️ Agent prioritization flow not yet tested
- ⚠️ Prioritization card rendering not yet tested
